# Problem 1  

First load the data, `birth1` and `birth2`, which indicate the gender (male=1, female=0) of reported first (second) born children in 100 families.
All families in this country have a maximum of two children.

```r
data(homeworkch2)  #
```



## Problem 1 a

  Data are generated by binomial trials with probability of obtaining a boy `p.b`, 

```r
p.b = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)
prior = rep(1/1000, 1000)
likelihood = dbinom(sum(birth1) + sum(birth2), 
    size = length(c(birth1, birth2)), prob = p.b)  # likelihood of data given 1000 models (binomial success parameter)
naive.posterior = prior * likelihood
dat = data.frame(prior = prior, likelihood = likelihood, 
    posterior = naive.posterior, probability.boy = p.b)
pb.max = p.b[-log(likelihood) == min(-log(likelihood))]
```



  The model `p.b = 1` maximizes the posterior probability

```r
print(pb.max)
```
```
## [1] 0.5546
```
```r
qplot(probability.boy, posterior, data = dat, 
    geom = "line")
```

# Colophon 

Written using the excellent [knitr](http://yihui.github.com/knitr/).

Need to use not only the options below suggested by knitr docs

```r
opts_knit$set(base.url = "https://github.com/ashander/stat-rethink/raw/master/")
```



but also 

```r
opts_knit$set(out.format = "gfm")
```
