# Problem 1  

First load the data, `birth1` and `birth2`, which indicate the gender (male=1, female=0) of reported first (second) born children in 100 families.
All families in this country have a maximum of two children.

```r
data(homeworkch2)  #
```



## 1 a

  Data are generated by binomial trials with probability of obtaining a boy `p.b`, 

```r
p.b <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)
prior <- rep(1/1000, 1000)
likelihood <- dbinom(sum(birth1) + sum(birth2), 
    size = length(c(birth1, birth2)), prob = p.b)  # likelihood of data given 1000 models (binomial success parameter)
naive.posterior <- prior * likelihood
pb.max <- p.b[-log(likelihood) == min(-log(likelihood))]
```



  The model `p.b = 1` maximizes the posterior probability at the value

```
## [1] 0.5546
```




## 1 b

```r
p.b.sample <- sample(p.b, size = 10000, replace = TRUE, 
    prob = naive.posterior)
```
```

```
```r
p.b.sample <- p.b.sample[order(p.b.sample)]
post.50 <- c(p.b.sample[2500], p.b.sample[7500])
post.90 <- c(p.b.sample[500], p.b.sample[9500])
post.95 <- c(p.b.sample[250], p.b.sample[9750])
```



Posterior density intervals for probabilty of drawing a boy:
  
```
##  50 % interval:  0.5315 0.5786 
```
```
##  90 % interval:  0.4975 0.6106 
```
```
##  95 % interval:  0.4865 0.6216 
```



```r
dat = data.frame(prior = prior, likelihood = likelihood, 
    posterior = naive.posterior, probability.boy = p.b)
g = ggplot(dat) + geom_vline(xintercept = pb.max, 
    color = "red")
g = g + geom_vline(xintercept = post.50, color = "blue")
g = g + geom_vline(xintercept = post.90, color = "orange")
g = g + geom_vline(xintercept = post.95, color = "green")
g = g + geom_line(aes(probability.boy, posterior))
g

# Problem 2

## 2a

 Simulating the number of boys born in 200 births using `rbinom`, 10000 replicates

![plot of chunk prob2a](https://github.com/ashander/stat-rethink/raw/master/prob2a.png)


  The actual total births is right in the center of the distribution of predicted number of boys.
From this use of posterior predictive simulation, the model seems to fit the data well.


## 2b

 Simulating the number of first born boys in 100 births using `rbinom`, 10000 replicates

![plot of chunk prob2b](https://github.com/ashander/stat-rethink/raw/master/prob2b.png)


  The actual count of first born boys is less than the center of the predicted distribution.
Here, it looks like the model overpredicts the number of first-born boys.


## 2c

 Simulating the number of second born boys with sisters births using `rbinom`, 10000 replicates.

How many first-born girls were there, and how were the siblings born after girls distributed?
Note that the data are ordered by family.

```
## [1] 49
```


  
So, 49 girls were born first, and following those births, 39 boys and 10 girls were born. 
Now simulate 49 births and compare to acutal data (focusing as before on boys):

![plot of chunk prob2c](https://github.com/ashander/stat-rethink/raw/master/prob2c.png)


  The actual number of boys born girls (39 boys following 49 girls) exceeds by  _far_ the center of the predicted distribution.
This could be explained if a boy is more likely to be born following a girl.
Yet, the model performs well on births in aggregate.
This could be explained if the assumption of independence between sex of first and second born is invalid in general, and the increased likelihood of bearing girls following boys cancels out the above-demonstrated underprediction of second born boys following girls.



  
# Colophon 

Written using the excellent [knitr](http://yihui.github.com/knitr/).

Need to use not only the options below suggested by knitr docs

```r
opts_knit$set(base.url = "https://github.com/ashander/stat-rethink/raw/master/")
```



but also 

```r
opts_knit$set(out.format = "gfm")
```
